Give your projects a good ðŸ¦¶!

This is what I'd like to call an omnibus project management tool. I'm
building it to do everything I need when managing my own projects to ensure
that they all have a valid configuration, up-to-date dependencies and a
consistent README style.

Repositories to check are detected through two mechanism:
* If a `.gitmodules` file is present either in the current directory or the
  one where `Kick.toml` is found, this is used to detect repositories to
  manage.
* If a `.git` folder is present, `git remote get-url origin` is used to
  determine its name and repo.

So the intent is primarily to use this separate from the projects being
managed, by adding each project as a submodule like so.

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/udoprog/OxidizeBot repos/OxidizeBot
```

> **Note:** For an example of this setup, see [my `projects` repo].

Kick can also be used without configuration in any standalone repository.
This is really all you need to get started, I frequently make use of `kick`
commands in regular repositories.

[my `projects` repo]: https://github.com/udoprog/projects

## Overview

This is an overview of the sections in the README:

* [Configuration][config]
* [Tour of commands](#tour-of-commands)
* [Run Github Workflows](#run-github-workflows)
* [Github Actions](#github-actions)
* [Staged changes](#staged-changes)
* [Repo sets](#repo-sets)
* [Packaging actions](#packaging-actions)
* [Version specification](#version-specification)
* [Defining variables for Github Actions](#defining-variables-for-github-actions)

<br>

## Configuration

Kick optionally reads `Kick.toml`, for how to configure projects. See the
[configuration documentation][config].

<br>

## Tour of commands

This section details some of my favorite things that Kick can do for you.
For a complete list of options, make use of `--help`.

Kick can `check`, which performs a project-specific sanity such as checking
that READMEs are up-to-date with their corresponding sources, badges are
configured, github actions are correctly configured and much more.

Kick can effortlessly package your Rust projects using actions such
`gzip`,`zip`, or packaging systems such as `rpm`, `deb`, or `msi` preparing
them for distribution.

Kick can run custom commands over git modules using convenient filters.
Combined with [repo sets](#repo-sets). Performing batch maintenance over
many git projects has never been easier!
* Want to do something with every project that hasn't been released yet? Try
  `kick run --unreleased`.
* Want to do something with every project that is out-of-sync with their
  remote? Try `kick run --outdated`.

And much much more!

<br>

## Run Github Workflows

![Matrix and WSL integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/udoprog/kick/main/images/wsl.png)

Kick can run Github workflows locally using `kick run --job <job>`.

This tries to use system utilities which are available locally in order to
run the workflow on the appropriate operating system as specified through
`runs-on`.

This also comes with support for matrix expansion.

Supported integrations are:
* Running on the same operating system as where Kick is run (default).
* Running Linux on Windows through WSL.

<br>

## Github Actions

Kick shines the brightest when used in combination with Github Actions. To
facilitate this, the Kick repo can be used in a job directly:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
  - uses: udoprog/kick@nightly
  - run: kick --version
```

In particular it is useful to specify a global `KICK_VERSION` using the
[wobbly version specification][wobbly-versions] so that all kick commands
that run will use the same version number.

```yaml
# If the `version` input is not available through a `workflow_dispatch`, defaults to a dated release.
env:
  KICK_VERSION: "${{github.event.inputs.version}} || %date"
```

<br>

## Staged changes

If you specify `--save`, proposed changes that can be applied to a project
will be applied. If `--save` is not specified the collection of changes will
be saved to `changes.gz` (in the root) to be applied later using `kick
apply`.

```text
> kick check
repos/kick/README.md: Needs update
repos/kick/src/main.rs: Needs update
2023-04-13T15:05:34.162247Z  WARN kick: Not writing changes since `--save` was not specified
2023-04-13T15:05:34.162252Z  INFO kick: Writing commit to ../changes.gz, use `kick changes` to review it later
```

Applying the staged changes:

```text
> kick changes --save
repos/kick/README.md: Fixing
repos/kick/src/main.rs: Fixing
2023-04-13T15:06:23.478579Z  INFO kick: Removing ../changes.gz
```

<br>

## Repo sets

Commands can produce sets under certain circumstances, the sets are usually
called `good` and `bad` depending on the outcome when performing the work
over the repo.

If this is set during a run, it will store sets of repos, such as the set
for which a command failed. This set can then later be re-used through the
`--set <id>` switch.

For a list of available sets, you can simply list the `sets` folder:

```text
sets\bad
sets\bad-20230414050517
sets\bad-20230414050928
sets\bad-20230414051046
sets\good-20230414050517
sets\good-20230414050928
sets\good-20230414051046
```

> **Note** the three most recent versions of each set will be retained.

Set files are simply lists of repositories, which supports comments by
prefixing lines with `#`. They are intended to be edited by hand if needed.

```text
repos/kick
# ignore this for now
# repos/unsync
```

<br>

## Packaging actions

The following actions are packaging actions:
* `zip` - Build .zip archives.
* `gzip` - Build .tar.gz archives.
* `msi` - Build .msi packages using wix.
* `rpm` - Build .rpm packages (builtin method).
* `deb` - Build .deb packages (builtin method).

These all look at the `[package]` section in the configuration to determine
what to include in a given package. For example:

```toml
[[package.files]]
source = "desktop/se.tedro.JapaneseDictionary.desktop"
dest = "/usr/share/applications/"
mode = "600"
```

Note that:
* The default mode for files is 655.
* Where approproate, the default version specification is a wildcard version, or `*`.

When a version specification is used, it supports the following formats:
* `*` - any version.
* `= 1.2.3` - exact version.
* `> 1.2.3` - greater than version.
* `>= 1.2.3` - greater than or equal to version.
* `< 1.2.3` - less than version.
* `<= 1.2.3` - less than or equal to version.

<br>

### `rpm` specific settings

For the `rpm` action, you can specify requires to add to the generated
archive in `Kick.toml`:

```toml
[[package.rpm.requires]]
package = "tesseract-langpack-jpn"
version = ">= 4.1.1"
```

<br>

### `deb` specific settings

For the `deb` action, you can specify dependencies to add to the generated
archive in `Kick.toml`:

```toml
[[package.rpm.depends]]
package = "tesseract-ocr-jpn"
version = ">= 4.1.1"
```

<br>

### The `msi` action

The `msi` action builds an MSI package.

It is configured by a single `wix/<main>.wsx` file in the repo. For an
example, [see the `jpv` project].

When building a wix package, we define the following variables that should
be used:
* `Root` - The root directory of the project. Use this for all files
  referenced.
* `Version` - The version of the package being build in the correct format
  the MSI expects.
* `Platform` - The platform the package is being built for. Either `x86` or
  `x64`. This is simply expected to be passed along to the `Platform`
  attribute in the `Package` element.
* `Win64` - Is either `x86_64` or `x86`. This is simply expected to be
  passed along to any elements with a `Win64` attribute.
* `ProgramFilesFolder` - The directory that corresponds to the
  platform-specific program files folder to use.
* `BinaryName` - The name of the main binary.
* `BinaryPath` - The path to the main binary. Should not be `Root` prefixed.

[see the `jpv` project]: https://github.com/udoprog/jpv/tree/main/wix

<br>

## Version specification

Some actions need to determine a version to use, such as when creating a
github release or building a package.

For these you can:
* Provide the version through the `--version <version>` switch.
* Defining the `KICK_VERSION` environment variable.

This primarily supports plain versions, dates, or tags, such as `1.2.3`,
`2021-01-01`, or `nightly1` and will be coerced as appropriate into a
target version specification depending in which type of package is being
built.

This also supports simple expressions such as `$VALUE || %date` which are
evaluated left-to-right and picks the first non-empty version defined.

For a full specification of the supported format, see the [wobbly version
specification][wobbly-versions].

<br>

## Defining variables for Github Actions

Sometimes you want to export information from Kick so that it can be used in
other Github Actions, most commonly this involves the resolved version from
a [version specification](#version-specification).

The `define` command can easily be used to achieve this:

```yaml
# If the `version` input is not available through a `workflow_dispatch`, defaults to a dated release.
env:
  KICK_VERSION: "${{github.event.inputs.version}} || %date"

jobs:
  build:
  - uses: udoprog/kick@nightly
  - run: kick define --github-action
    id: release
  # echo the selected version
  - run: echo ${{steps.release.outputs.version}}
  # echo "yes" or "no" depending on if the version is a pre-release or not.
  - run: echo ${{steps.release.outputs.pre}}
```

Note that version information is exported by default when specifying
`--github-action`. For other information that can be exported, see `define
--help`.
